## My process

### Technology Used

This project was built using the following frontend technologies and methodologies:

- **Semantic HTML5 markup:** To provide a clear and meaningful structure to the content.
- **CSS custom properties:** To efficiently manage and reuse style values throughout the project.
- **CSS Grid:** To create powerful and flexible layouts with precise control over placement and alignment.
- **Flexbox:** To create flexible and responsive layouts.
- **JavaScript:** To add interactivity and dynamic functionality to the project.
- **SASS:** To write CSS more efficiently with nested rules, variables, and mixins.
- **BEM (Block Element Modifier):** To create modular, reusable, and maintainable CSS code.

### What I Learned

Throughout the development of this project, I had the opportunity to acquire new skills and knowledge. Here's what I gained:

- Leveraged the power of SASS map and list to ensure consistent and responsive media queries across different devices. 🎨💪
- Explored the usage of localstorage to store and retrieve theme values, enabling a seamless user experience across sessions. 🔒🌗
- Mastered the art of styling SVGs, specifically utilizing it for the captivating menu icon. 🎨

These learnings have not only enhanced my proficiency as a frontend developer but also opened up exciting possibilities for future projects. 🚀💡

### Continued development

The techniques I learned during this project will be invaluable in my future development work. Excited to apply these skills going forward! 🚀

### Useful resources

Here are some valuable resources that I found helpful during the development of this project:

- [The Net Ninja - Playlist: Light & Dark Mode with CSS Variables](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9jXaLsxbEmsPSOlb40ZLaKN) - This video playlist provided me with a comprehensive understanding of setting up themes using CSS variables.

- [MDN: prefers-color-scheme](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme) - The MDN documentation on prefers-color-scheme­ was instrumental in implementing the color scheme to allow the user's browser to load their preferred theme.

- [MDN: transform-origin](https://­developer.mozilla.org­/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/­transform-origin) - The MDN documentation on transform-origin helped me precisely set the origin of the menu SVG icon, resulting in the desired visual effect.

These resources played a vital role in enhancing my understanding and enabling the successful implementation of key features in this project.

## Acknowledgments

The inspiration for the Light/Dark theme in this project came from [Melvin Aguilar's - Intro section with dropdown navigation (React + Tailwind + Dark mode) solution](https://www.frontendmentor.io/solutions/intro-section-with-dropdown-navigation-tmQXOQU78e). This creative approach to implementing a dropdown navigation with React, Tailwind, and Dark mode served as a valuable reference and source of inspiration.
